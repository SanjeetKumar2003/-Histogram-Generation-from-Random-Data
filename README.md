Problem Statement
You are a data analyst working for a marketing company.
The company wants to understand the distribution of customer ages in their
database.
Your task is to create a histogram that visualizes this distribution using
randomly generated age data.
Generate a dataset of 1000 customer ages, assuming the ages range from 18
to 80 years old.
Then, create a histogram to visualize the distribution of these ages.
Make sure to include appropriate labels and a title for the histogram.
The histogram should have 10 bins.
Use matplotlib for visualization.
